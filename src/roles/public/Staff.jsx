          The induction event/session is your start point in the process of becoming familiar with,
          and settling into, University life.
          During your induction session you will be introduced to your workplace, team, and supervisors.
          you will be informed with your duties and schedules. Also, you will be handed your ID card,
          username, and passwords of the professors-related digital platforms.
          Your induction session is your opportunity to investigate, to ask questions,
          and to introduce yourself to the employees.
          Always feel free to explore your environment, and ask for help if needed.
